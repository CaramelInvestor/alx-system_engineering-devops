**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: [8 PM] (WAT)
  - End Time: [9 PM] (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - Service Affected: Web Application
  - User Experience: Users experienced intermittent downtime and slow response times.
  - User Affected: Approximately 30% of users encountered disruptions.

**Timeline:**
- **Issue Detection:**
  - Detected on [8:30 PM] (WAT) by monitoring alerts indicating increased latency.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated frontend servers, suspecting a capacity issue.
  - Assumed the root cause to be a sudden spike in user traffic.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Focused initially on CDN performance without concrete evidence.
  - Explored potential DDoS attack, leading to unnecessary security checks.
- **Escalation:**
  - Escalated to the Infrastructure and Networking team after frontend investigations.
- **Resolution:**
  - Identified an unexpected surge in database queries causing the slowdown.
  - Resolved by optimizing database queries and adding additional server capacity.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - The primary issue stemmed from inefficient database queries causing a bottleneck.
  - Sudden user activity surge exacerbated the problem, leading to degraded performance.
- **Resolution:**
  - Optimized database queries to enhance efficiency.
  - Implemented horizontal scaling for the database to accommodate increased load.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Improve database indexing for frequently accessed queries.
  - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load during traffic spikes.
  - Enhance monitoring for real-time visibility into database performance.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - [ ] Conduct a comprehensive review of database queries and optimize where necessary.
  - [ ] Implement automated scaling policies for handling sudden increases in user activity.
  - [ ] Establish a proactive monitoring system to detect performance anomalies.
  - [ ] Conduct a post-incident review with involved teams for knowledge sharing.
  
**Conclusion:**
The web stack outage was a result of unforeseen database inefficiencies amplified by a sudden surge in user activity. While the incident caused temporary disruptions, prompt detection, and targeted resolution strategies ensured minimal impact on the majority of users. Moving forward, the implementation of corrective measures, including query optimization and automated scaling, aims to fortify the system against similar issues in the future. Continuous monitoring enhancements and collaborative post-incident reviews will further bolster our ability to maintain a robust and reliable web infrastructure.
